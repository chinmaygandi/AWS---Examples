# AWS---Examples

In this project, we will learn to implement end to end AWS Stack [Dynamo DB, API gateway, Lambda, SNS]. This is to demonstrate how we can leverage AWS services to make a working application. Our project's goal is simple - There is a public joke API (https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) that sends a joke in every in JSON format after hitting the API as you can see below. We need to get this joke in our mailbox and store it in our dynamo database as and when the API is hit.
